# Data Collection and Market Analysis Project

Welcome to the Data Collection and Market Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on data collection, SQL analysis, and preparation for a Tableau visualization. The dataset has been scraped from public records of users of Mountain Project. Below is a comprehensive guide to the contents of this repository and how to utilize them effectively.

## Introduction
This project involves the collection and analysis of user data from Mountain Project, a popular climbing community website. The primary goal is to scrape relevant data, clean and prepare it for analysis, and perform SQL queries to derive meaningful insights. The final visualization of this data can be found on Tableau.

## Project Files

### clean_data.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to cleaning the scraped user data. It includes:
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Handling missing values
- Data transformation and normalization
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant information

### scrape_user_data.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the web scraping logic for extracting user data from Mountain Project. It includes:
- Setting up the web scraping environment
- Identifying the target data points
- Writing and executing the scraping scripts
- Saving the scraped data into a structured format

### sql_queries_tick_breakdown.sql
This SQL script performs various analyses on the cleaned dataset. Key analyses include:
- Breakdown of ticks (records of climbs)
- Aggregation of data by user, climb type, and location
- Identification of trends and patterns in user activity

## Tableau Visualization
The final step in this project is visualizing the processed data using Tableau. The visualization provides an interactive and comprehensive view of the insights derived from the dataset. You can explore the visualization at the following link:
